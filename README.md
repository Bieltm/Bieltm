    <h1>Hey! I'm Biel Torruella</h1>
    <p>When I was 11 years old, a teacher taught me Scratch, and I started to make my own games, this made me to get interested in how games worked internally, watching a lot of videos about it, then I became interested in how other projects like web pages worked, etc. and step by step it made me passionate about the world of computing.
Nowadays, I'm an 18 years old student of Computer Engineering, and I'm excited to continue discovering new things about this world.</p>
