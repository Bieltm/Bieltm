    <h1>Hey! I'm Biel Torruella</h1>
    <p>When I was 11 years old, a teacher taught me Scratch, and I started to make my own games, this made me to get interested in how games worked internally, watching a lot of videos about it, then I became interested in how other projects like web pages worked, etc. and step by step it made me passionate about the world of computing.</p>
    <p>At 17 years old I started my Computer Engineering degree and began to practice with some languages like C, Java, Python and Assembler, by my way I learned how to create a web page by learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Nowadays I'm really interested in learning about Cybersecurity and IA.</p>
